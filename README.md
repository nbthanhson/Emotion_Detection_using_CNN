# Emotion Detection
We are going to create a facial recognition model dividing into seven different types of emotion. It utilizes Word Embedding and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras to build the model.

This model uses the FER-2013 dataset consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0 = Angry, 1 = Disgust, 2 = Fear, 3 = Happy, 4 = Sad, 5 = Surprise, 6 = Neutral). These are split into 28,709 images for training and 3,589 images for testing.

My model used the FER-2013 dataset and CNN to train with the accuracy up to 70%.
